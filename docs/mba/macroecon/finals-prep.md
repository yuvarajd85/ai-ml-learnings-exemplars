## Unemployment and Inflation 
### **Summary and Key Points from ECON 621 - Class 5 Notes**

#### **Unemployment and Inflation (Chapter 14)**

#### **Unemployment**
- **Definitions**:
  - **Unemployed**: Those not working but actively looking for a job in the last 4 weeks.
  - **Employed**: Working full-time or part-time.
  - **Labor Force**: The sum of employed and unemployed individuals.
  - **Labor Force Participation Rate**: Labor Force / Population (16+ years old).
  - **Discouraged Workers**: People who have stopped looking for a job.
  - **Marginally Attached Workers**: Previously job-seeking but not actively looking now.
  - **Underemployed Workers**: Part-time workers unable to find full-time work.

- **Unemployment Rate**:
  - Can understate true unemployment by excluding discouraged and underemployed workers.
  - Can overstate issues as some unemployed people are in job transition.
  - Rises during recessions and may stay high during recoveries.
  - **Jobless recoveries** (weak GDP growth + slow employment recovery) seen in recent economic recoveries.

- **Types of Unemployment**:
  1. **Frictional Unemployment** – Temporary unemployment while workers search for suitable jobs.
  2. **Structural Unemployment** – Jobs not matching workers due to:
     - Minimum wages or unions keeping wages above equilibrium.
     - Efficiency wages incentivizing workers.
     - Skill mismatches (e.g., technology replacing jobs).
     - Government policies affecting labor incentives.
  3. **Cyclical Unemployment** – Caused by economic downturns (e.g., recessions).

- **Natural Rate of Unemployment**:
  - Normal unemployment rate fluctuates around this.
  - Affected by labor force composition, institutions (e.g., LinkedIn), and government policies.

#### **Measuring Unemployment**
- The **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** provides labor market data.
- Different measures exist:
  - **U-3** (Official Unemployment Rate).
  - **U-5** (Includes discouraged workers).
  - **U-6** (Includes underemployed part-time workers).
- Education level affects unemployment:
  - Higher education correlates with lower unemployment.
  - Labor force participation trends differ by gender and age.

#### **Inflation**
- **Definition**: A general rise in prices, measured by:
  - **CPI (Consumer Price Index)** – Used for Social Security adjustments.
  - **PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)** – Preferred by the Federal Reserve.
  - **PPI (Producer Price Index)** and **GDP deflator** – Other measures.

- **Why CPI and PCE Differ**:
  1. **Substitution Effect** – PCE adjusts for shifts to cheaper goods.
  2. **Weighting Differences** – CPI surveys consumers; PCE tracks business sales.
  3. **Scope** – CPI measures out-of-pocket spending, while PCE includes employer-paid expenses (e.g., health insurance).

- **Costs of Inflation**:
  1. **Psychological Effects** – People dislike rising prices even if wages increase.
  2. **Fixed Income Impact** – Retirees suffer if incomes aren’t adjusted.
  3. **Shoe-Leather Costs** – Effort to minimize cash holdings.
  4. **Menu Costs** – The cost of changing prices frequently.
  5. **Unit of Account Costs** – Price distortion and tax inefficiencies.
  6. **Financial Uncertainty**:
     - Unexpected inflation redistributes wealth (hurts lenders, benefits borrowers).
     - Reduces investment and economic growth.

#### **Deflation and Disinflation**
- **Deflation**: Falling prices, often indicating economic distress (e.g., Great Depression).
- **Disinflation**: Controlled reduction of inflation, often requiring economic slowdowns.
- **Current Trends**: The Federal Reserve is working on disinflation (2022-2025).

#### **Conclusion**
- Unemployment and inflation have complex effects on the economy.
- Different unemployment and inflation measures provide a clearer economic picture.
- Government policies and economic trends impact both labor markets and price stability.
