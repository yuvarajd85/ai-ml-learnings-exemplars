## Week4-Notes

----

Here's a summarized version of **Chapter 2: Executing Strategy – Project Management** from the *POM610* PowerPoint slides:

---

##  **Chapter Summary: Executing Strategy – Project Management**

###  **1. Strategic Role of Projects**

* Projects are a key mechanism for executing organizational strategies.
* A company’s **de facto strategy** is defined more by the **projects it chooses** than by statements or plans.
* Projects must align with the **business case** and provide measurable **strategic benefits**.

---

###  **2. Project Portfolio Management**

* Projects are managed as part of a **portfolio**, also known as the **aggregate project plan**.
* Interactions among projects must be considered.
* **ROI alone is not enough** to select projects—strategic fit matters more.

---

###  **3. Project Selection & Ownership**

* Not all projects can or should be executed—**selection is critical**.
* The **project owner** (on behalf of the CEO) ensures strategic alignment, stakeholder engagement, and assists the PM with issues.
* Project Managers (PMs) focus on delivering **outputs**, not benefits.

---

###  **4. Characteristics of Projects**

* Unique, time-bound, goal-specific, with **limited budgets** and **high importance**.
* Require **flexibility**, minimal middle management, and direct communication between PM and team.

---

###  **5. Types of Projects**

1. **Derivative**: Incremental improvements.
2. **Platform**: Mid-range enhancements.
3. **Breakthrough**: Next-generation innovations.
4. **R\&D**: Research for new knowledge.

---

###  **6. Risk and the Iron Triangle**

* Two risk phases: **Execution** and **Benefits Realization**.
* Execution risks involve the **Iron Triangle**:

  * Missing the **deadline**
  * Going **over budget**
  * Failing to meet **specifications**

---

###  **7. The Business Case**

* Details goals, benefits, cost, timeline, risks, and alternatives.
* Aligns the project with the organization’s **strategic vision**.

---

###  **8. Project Life Cycle**

* Projects may follow **Stretched-S** or **Exponential** trajectories.
* These influence output timelines and response to budget cuts or delays.

---

###  **9. Project Planning Tools**

* **Project Charter** includes: objectives, scope, milestones, budget, risks, stakeholders, and evaluation methods.
* Use of:

  * **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
  * **RACI Matrix** (Responsible, Accountable, Consult, Inform)
  * **Gantt Charts**

---

###  **10. Scheduling and Critical Path**

* **Planning**: What and in what order.
* **Scheduling**: When, how long, which tasks are **critical** and which have **slack**.

---

###  **11. Change Management**

* Change Managers help teams adapt to new roles/systems.
* Tools include training, IT, behavioral and social science techniques.

---

###  **12. Project Management Software**

* Tools range from simple to complex (e.g., **Microsoft Project**).
* Powerful tools are suited for large-scale projects.

---

###  **13. Agile Project Management**

* Involves **sprints/iterations** of 1–4 weeks.
* Emphasizes team collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback.
* Benefits: improved outcomes, morale, and satisfaction.

---

###  **14. Cost–Time Trade-Offs (Crashing)**

* If timelines are tight, tasks can be **crashed** (faster execution by adding better or more resources).
* PMs manage these trade-offs to balance cost and completion time.

---

##  **Key Takeaways**

* Projects are strategic tools, not just tactical exercises.
* Successful execution demands structured planning, stakeholder involvement, risk management, and adaptability.
* Tools like WBS, RACI, Agile methods, and software help in precise execution.

---

## Week-5 Notes

Here's a **summary** and **key highlights** from **Chapter 4: Capacity and Scheduling** of the *POM510* course slides:

---

##  **Chapter 4 Summary: Capacity and Scheduling**

###  **1. Introduction to Capacity**

* **Capacity** is the rate at which a system can produce output.
* Applies to both **manufacturing and service organizations**.
* Divided into **short-term** (e.g., staffing adjustments) and **long-term** (e.g., facility construction) decisions.

---

##  **2. Long-Term Capacity Planning**

* Strategic and expensive—**hard to reverse once implemented**.
* Requires careful analysis of demand, cost, and facility location.

---

##  **3. Key Capacity Concepts**

* **Bottlenecks** limit overall system output.
* **Time dimension** must be considered in measuring capacity.
* **Capacity planning** must account for **multiple outputs** and **natural inefficiencies** like defects or waste.

---

## **4. Capacity Strategies**

* **Facility size planning**: Larger facilities lower costs (economies of scale), but only when run at optimal capacity.
* **Economies of scope**: Spreading fixed costs across a variety of outputs using flexible technologies.
* **Anticyclic output**: Adding products/services that offset seasonal or market cycles.

---

##  **5. Scheduling and Capacity Utilization**

* **Scheduling** determines when tasks should start and finish.
* **Poor scheduling** can lead to perceived capacity problems.
* Tools: **Gantt charts**, **loading methods** (finite vs infinite), **operation splitting**, and **preemption**.

---

## **6. Scheduling Services**

* Focus shifts to **matching inputs (labor, materials, facilities)** with variable demand.
* Approaches include:

  * Floating workers
  * Overtime
  * Off-peak pricing
  * Use of tech (self-service, automation)

---

##  **7. Yield/Revenue Management**

* Allocating **fixed service capacity** to maximize revenue.
* Used in industries like airlines, hotels, and subscription-based services.
* **Overbooking** strategies reduce cost of no-shows (based on the "newsboy problem").

---

##  **8. Short-Term Capacity Adjustments**

**Techniques to increase capacity:**
I. **Add Resources** – Overtime, part-time workers, leasing
II. **Improve Resource Use** – Cross-training, shift staggering
III. **Modify Output** – Standardization, partial self-service
IV. **Modify Demand** – Pricing, promotions, demand partitioning

---

##  **9. Process-Flow Analysis**

* Mapping product or service flow helps identify **bottlenecks**, **inventory build-up**, and **time delays**.
* **Utilization** = actual output vs expected output
* **Efficiency** = output/input

---

##  **10. Learning Curve**

* Productivity increases as experience grows.
* Every time output doubles, labor time reduces to a predictable percentage.
* Critical in **new or complex process environments**.

---

##  **11. Queuing and Waiting Lines**

* Waiting lines (queues) are a central challenge in service operations.
* **Perceived wait time** is affected by psychological factors:

  * Unoccupied time feels longer
  * Uncertainty or anxiety increases perceived wait
  * Group waiting feels shorter than solo waiting

---

##  **Key Insights**

* Capacity must be **proactively planned**, not just reactively managed.
* Both **technical efficiency** and **customer psychology** play major roles in service capacity.
* Effective scheduling and demand management improve resource utilization and customer satisfaction.

## **2. What is Six Sigma?**

* A **disciplined, data-driven** approach to eliminate defects.
* Developed by **Bill Smith at Motorola (1986)**.
* "Sigma" refers to standard deviation; "Six Sigma" implies near-perfect quality (3.4 DPMO).
* It's a **flexible system** for achieving and sustaining business success through process improvement.

---

## **3. Six Sigma Methodology: DMAIC**

### **Define**

* Identify customer requirements, project goals, problem/opportunity.
* **Tools**: Benchmarking, QFD (Quality Function Deployment).

### **Measure**

* Collect performance data, define metrics (e.g., DPMO, process sigma).
  * Understand variation:
  $$
    \sigma^2_T = \sigma^2_p + \sigma^2_m
  $$
    Total variation = Process + Measurement variation

### **Analyze**

* Identify root causes of variation using:

  * Brainstorming
  * Cause-and-effect (Fishbone/Ishikawa) diagrams
  * Process capability analysis

### **Improve**

* Develop and test solutions (e.g., **Design of Experiments (DOE)**).
* Use **Taguchi methods** to optimize design while minimizing variability.

### **Control**

* Sustain improvements using monitoring systems and procedures to prevent regression.

---

## **4. Tools and Concepts in Detail**

### **Benchmarking**

* Compare with best-in-class practices, products, or services.
* Industry-independent and proactive.

### **Quality Function Deployment (QFD)**

* Translates customer needs into product/service specifications.
* Tools like the "House of Quality" matrix (Figure 8.4, 8.5).

### **Process Capability Analysis**

* Evaluates whether a process meets specifications.
* Uses capability index (Cpk) and natural variation analysis (Figure 8.9, 8.10).

### **Design of Experiments (DOE)**

* Goes beyond “one factor at a time” testing.
* Determines the interaction effects and optimal factor settings.

### **Measurement System Analysis**

* Examines **bias**, **linearity**, and **stability** in data collection.

---

## **5. Creativity and Team Dynamics**

* **Enhancing Team Creativity**:

  * Use analogies, brainwriting, NGT (Nominal Group Technique)
