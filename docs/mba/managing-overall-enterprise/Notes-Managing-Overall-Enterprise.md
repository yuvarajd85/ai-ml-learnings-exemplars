**1. CAPS IM CHEAT SHEET (FAST REFERENCE)**

A. What each department really controls

R&D
	•	Performance, Size, MTBF → product appeal
	•	Revisions → reset age, shift position
	•	New products → expansion into new segments
	•	Completion dates → lock other departments

Marketing
	•	Price → demand & positioning
	•	Promo budget → awareness
	•	Sales budget → accessibility
	•	Sales forecast → must be accurate
	•	Segment buying criteria → must match specs

Production
	•	Schedule units → drives cost + inventory
	•	Capacity → long-term volume
	•	Automation → labor cost + R&D time
	•	Adding/removing lines → strategic expansion/contraction

Finance
	•	Bonds, stock, current debt → fund big decisions
	•	Dividends → raise stock price
	•	Emergency loans → FAIL CONDITION (avoid)
	•	Proformas → test your plan before submitting

⸻

B. Hard Rules for Winning Capsim
	•	Never run out of inventory (lost sales kill you).
	•	Never take emergency loans (destroys stock price & margins).
	•	Products must stay inside fine cut of their segment.
	•	Forecast conservatively (use worst-case logic).
	•	Keep automation high for low-tech, moderate for high-tech.
	•	Price inside acceptable range or lose massive demand.
	•	Use the Courier every round for competitive intelligence.

⸻

C. Customer Criteria (quick map)

High End
	•	Position = most important
	•	Age = 0
	•	MTBF = high
	•	Price = least important

Traditional
	•	Age around 2
	•	Balanced importance

Low End
	•	Price most important
	•	High age acceptable
	•	Low MTBF acceptable
	•	Position = least important

Performance
	•	Performance max
	•	High MTBF
	•	Higher price OK

Size
	•	Tiny products
	•	High accuracy
	•	Higher price OK

----

**2. ROUND-BY-ROUND DECISION WORKFLOW**

BEFORE ROUND 1 (Prep)
	•	Read Industry Conditions Report
	•	Read Courier Round 0
	•	Map segment centers + ideal spots
	•	Decide on one strategy → stick to it

⸻

EVERY ROUND WORKFLOW (non-negotiable)

STEP 1 — R&D
	•	Check segment drift
	•	Move product toward ideal spot
	•	Keep completion before 12/31
	•	Avoid huge year-long R&D delays (caused by automation)

STEP 2 — MARKETING
	•	Check all competitor prices from Courier
	•	Set your price inside segment range
	•	Promo = keep awareness near 100
	•	Sales = build accessibility (1 product: ~$3M; 2+: ~$4.5M)
	•	Sales forecast =
	•	Take last year’s demand
	•	Apply segment growth
	•	Adjust for YOUR improvements
	•	THEN CUT BY 10–20% (worst-case forecast)

STEP 3 — PRODUCTION
	•	Units to produce = forecast – inventory + 10% buffer
	•	Avoid inventory > 2 months of demand
	•	Increase automation where strategy says so
	•	Add capacity ONLY if needed 2–3 years ahead
	•	Kill unprofitable products slowly, not instantly

STEP 4 — FINANCE
	•	Fund plant upgrades using
	•	Long-term debt
	•	Bonds
	•	Stock issuances (sparingly)
	•	Maintain cash > $10M buffer
	•	No emergency loans
	•	Use Proformas for every major decision

STEP 5 — SUBMIT DECISIONS
	•	Reopen Proformas
	•	Re-check production vs. marketing forecast
	•	Re-check R&D dates
	•	Submit

⸻

POST-ROUND CHECK (after results come in)

Look at Courier:
	•	Did you forecast correctly?
	•	Did you stock out?
	•	Did competitors move position?
	•	Which products missed buying criteria?
	•	Check your contribution margins vs. potential margins

Use this intel to refine next round.

	•	Crush competitors with price volume

⸻

E. PRODUCT LIFECYCLE FOCUS (PLC)

(Start high-tech; let product drift into lower segments over years.)

How you win
	•	Release a high-end product
	•	Let it age naturally into Traditional and Low End
	•	You milk a single product across multiple segments

R&D
	•	Build products early
	•	Do NOT reposition often
	•	Let age drift for price-sensitive markets

Marketing
	•	Change price as product slides down the curve

Production
	•	Scale capacity to support multi-year lifecycle

⸻

F. DIFFERENTIATOR WITH PLC FOCUS

(Premium positioning + long-term product lifecycle.)

Same as PLC, but with premium prices, higher MTBF, and more aggressive early R&D.

⸻

**1-PAGE CHEAT SHEET (Capsim Rehearsal + Real Game)**

1. R&D (Repositioning)
	•	Move each product toward next year’s Ideal Spot (from Segment Analysis).
	•	Finish on or before Dec 31.
	•	Bigger move → longer time.
	•	R&D completion cuts product age in half.
	•	Higher performance & smaller size = higher material cost.

Rule of thumb:
Always aim at next year’s ideal, not this year’s position.

⸻

2. Marketing (Price, Promo, Sales, Forecast)
	•	Set Price within acceptable range (segment-specific).
	•	Promo Budget: Builds Awareness (cap at 100%, diminishing returns after $3.0M).
	•	Sales Budget: Builds Accessibility (also caps at 100%).
	•	Forecast: Use a pessimistic estimate to avoid stockouts and emergency loans.

Rule of thumb:
Forecast = (Competitor demand gap × your share) × 0.9

⸻

3. Production (Units + Capacity)
	•	1st shift = normal cost
	•	2nd shift = +50% labor premium
	•	Avoid overtime (cost explosion).
	•	Inventory Carry Cost = 12% of unit cost.

Basic formula:
Production = Best-case forecast − Beginning inventory

Best-case forecast = Worst-case × 1.33

⸻

4. Capacity & Automation
	•	Capacity arrives next round (Dec 31).
	•	Automation slowdowns R&D (higher automation ⇒ longer revision times).
	•	Buy capacity if demand > first+second shift.
	•	Sell capacity you don’t need (gets 65% salvage value).

Plant cost formulas:
	•	Increase capacity:
Capacity × (6 + 4 × Automation)
	•	Automation to 10:
Capacity × (4 × (10 − Automation))

⸻

5. Finance
	•	Fund plant changes with:
	•	Stock issues
	•	Bond issues
	•	Short-term debt
	•	Don’t exceed leverage ratio (>3.0 is dangerous).
	•	Dividends are optional (only if excess cash).
	•	Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable affect demand and cash but use cautiously.

Rule:
Finance funds everything — decisions fail if you underfund.

⸻

6. Inventing a New Product
	•	Takes 1.4–3 years.
	•	Must buy capacity 1 year ahead.
	•	Must fund plant upgrades with Finance.
	•	Specs must target future (2–3 years out) segment ideal.

⸻

**Complete Example (One Product: Able – Traditional)**

R&D: Move to next year ideal (Pfmn ~5.8, Size ~14.2).
Price: ~$28 (mid-to-high range).
Promo: $1.2M → 80% awareness.
Sales: $1.4M → 75% accessibility.
Forecast: 1850 worst-case → 2460 best-case.
Production: Make ~2100 units.
Capacity: 1800 (ok)
Automation: Raise from 4 → 5.
Finance: Raise $15M via stock+bond mix to fund plant.

This is the pattern you repeat for all products.

⸻

**2. FULL ROUND-BY-ROUND DECISION WORKFLOW**

This is the exact process top Capsim teams follow.

⸻

📍 BEFORE ROUND 1 (Prep)
	1.	Read Industry Conditions.
	2.	Read Courier Round 0 (Segment Analysis pages 5–9).
	3.	Calculate next-year Ideal Spots for all segments.
	4.	Calculate demand forecasts & capacity gaps.
	5.	Check your Round 0 margins & consumer report areas.

⸻

ROUND 1 WORKFLOW

Step 1 — R&D

For each product:
	•	Move it onto next year’s ideal spot.
	•	Ensure completion before Dec 31.
	•	Keep MTBF mid-range for profitability unless segment demands high reliability.

Products: Able, Acre, Adam, Aft, Agape
(All recalculated per segment drift.)

⸻

Step 2 — Marketing

For each product:
	•	Set Price within acceptable range
	•	Promo budget: $1.0M–$1.5M
	•	Sales budget: $1.0M–$1.5M
	•	Apply pessimistic forecast (worse-case × 0.9)

⸻

Step 3 — Production

For each product:
	•	Compute Best-case forecast = Worst-case × 1.33
	•	Production Qty = Best-case − Inventory
	•	Avoid >2nd shift (50% premium)
	•	Avoid underproduction (stockouts kill profit)

⸻

Step 4 — Capacity & Automation
	•	Raise automation by +1 for Traditional/Size/Performance
	•	Raise +1–2 for Low End (automation-heavy, cost-leader segment)
	•	Do not exceed automation 7–8 early; it slows R&D drastically.
	•	Buy capacity where forecasts > plant bandwidth.

⸻

Step 5 — Finance
	•	Raise bonds or stock to fund plant changes.
	•	Keep leverage ≤ 3.0
	•	Use working capital intelligently.

⸻

Step 6 — (Optional) New Product
	•	Start R&D of your Round 3–4 High End sensor.
	•	Begin capacity purchase for future product.

⸻

ROUND 2–8 WORKFLOW (General Pattern)

Every Round:
	1.	Recompute next year ideal positions
	2.	Adjust R&D to stay inside fine cut
	3.	Raise/lower price according to customer expectations
	4.	Re-run forecast
	5.	Change production + plant according to capacity gaps
	6.	Update Finance to fund plant + avoid debt issues
	7.	Consider launching new products (Round 3–5)

Every 3 rounds:
	•	Increase automation (if it does not block R&D timing)
	•	Reassess contribution margins vs potential
	•	Reduce MTBF if needed (to cut material cost)

⸻

ROUND 8 (Final Round Strategy)
	•	Maximize profit
	•	Clear all inventory
	•	Reduce automation purchases (won’t pay off)
	•	Set price strategically for volume vs margin
	•	Buy back stock to improve EPS (optional)

⸻
