### Background and Governance

----

**Corporate Governance** refers to the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It balances the interests of a company’s stakeholders—including shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government, and the community.

### **Short Summary:**

Corporate governance ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in a company’s relationship with all its stakeholders. It involves mechanisms like board oversight, internal controls, ethical conduct, compliance, and disclosure practices. Good governance builds investor confidence, reduces risk, and supports sustainable business growth.
