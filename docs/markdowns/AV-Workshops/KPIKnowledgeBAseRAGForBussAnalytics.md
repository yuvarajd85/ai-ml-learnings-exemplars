# <u> KPI Copilot for Business Analytics </u>
In real analytics work, the biggest challenges are often:

- KPI definitions living across multiple documents and teams
- Inconsistent interpretation of the same metric (e.g., "churn", "activation", "revenue")
- Spending hours turning numbers into a clear, decision-ready weekly narrative


In this workshop, you'll build a KPI Copilot that helps solve exactly that.

## <u> What You'll Build</u>
A working assistant that can:

- Answer "What does this KPI mean?" questions using an internal metric glossary/data dictionary
- Provide grounded responses with references to the approved source material
- Generate a weekly performance narrative by combining KPI outputs with official definitions and reporting rules
- Include a lightweight quality checklist to reduce inconsistencies and prevent "made-up" definitions
