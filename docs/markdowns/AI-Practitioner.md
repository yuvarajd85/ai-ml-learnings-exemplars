## 🧾 **4. Key Topics to Master (Cheat Sheet Highlights)**

### 🔹 AI/ML Fundamentals

* Definitions: AI vs ML vs Deep Learning vs GenAI
* Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
* ML Lifecycle: Data prep → Model training → Deployment → Monitoring
* AWS Services: S3, SageMaker, Comprehend, Rekognition, etc.

### 🔹 Generative AI

* Concepts: Tokens, embeddings, transformer models
* Lifecycle: Use case → Model selection → RAG/fine-tuning → Evaluation → Deployment
* Risks: Hallucinations, bias, explainability

### 🔹 Foundation Models (FMs)

* Available via **Amazon Bedrock**, **SageMaker JumpStart**
* RAG architecture
* Prompt engineering: few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought
* Evaluation Metrics: ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore

### 🔹 Responsible AI

* Fairness, bias, explainability (via SageMaker Clarify, Model Monitor)
* Transparent models
* Bias-variance tradeoff

### 🔹 Security & Governance

* AWS Services: IAM, Macie, KMS, CloudTrail
* Compliance tools: AWS Config, Audit Manager, Trusted Advisor
